# Pomotroid

React based pomodoro timer implementation. Inspired by [Pomotroid](https://splode.github.io/pomotroid/) by splode.

Check out the application [here](https://pomotroid.pages.dev/).

## Tech Stack

* React 
* Typescript
* Tailwind CSS
* Themes are taken from the pomotroid project.


## Note

Currently it doesn't offers all the features that original pomotroid offers like notification sound, adjusting the timer and number of sessions. I am still working on these features and make the source code more structured and readable.


## TODO

* Implement settings page for customizing timers
* Implement notification sounds

Any suggestions or PR's would be greatly appreciated.
